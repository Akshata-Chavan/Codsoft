**Project Description: Number Game in Java**

This Java project, named `numgame`, is an interactive number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly selected number between 100 and 1000. The game provides the player with a limited number of trials (7 in this case) to guess the correct number.

### Features:

- **Random Number Generation:** The program generates a random number between 100 and 1000, which the player has to guess.

- **User Interaction:** The player interacts with the program by inputting their guesses using the console.

- **Trial Limit:** The game has a set number of trials (7 in this implementation), and the player must guess the correct number within these trials.

- **Feedback Mechanism:** After each guess, the program provides feedback to the player, indicating whether the guess is correct, out of range, too small, or too large.

### How to Play:

1. The game starts by informing the player that a number has been selected between 100 and 1000.

2. The player is prompted to guess the number within a specified number of trials.

3. The player inputs their guess, and the program provides feedback based on the comparison of the guess with the randomly generated number.

4. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number, runs out of trials, or decides to exit.

### Running the Game:

To play the game, execute the `numgame` class. The program will guide you through the guessing process, providing feedback and announcing the outcome at the end of the game.

Enjoy the challenge of guessing the right number!
